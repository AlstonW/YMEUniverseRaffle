Python 3.X program to enter the YMEUniverse Bred raffle

You will need to have  **Requests** installed.

###Setup Instructions:
Run `git clone https://github.com/donnersyt/YMEUniverseRaffle.git` in to
your terminal / command prompt.

After this, use `cd YMEUniverseRaffle` to navigate to the folder.

Set up the config.json file...
* If you're using GMAIL, enter your gmail address
* If you have your own email domain, enter that in the my_domain
* Enter your name, city and size (UK)
To run, you can enter 

`python3 threaded.py` or `python3 unthreaded.py` 

Threaded is MUCH faster for entering.
